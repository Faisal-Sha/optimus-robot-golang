Code Organization
- Separate core logic from input and output. (write a seperate file for IO operations)
- Encapsulate state changes in dedicated functions (use member functions in state to change it)
- Use constants and helper functions instead of raw characters (use Enum for types of cells '@', 'X' etc) (Avoid hardcoding)

Correctness Fixes
- Reset visited states after destroying a wall (clear(r.visited) is needed after grid change)
- Validate grid input instead of padding or truncating silently (better throw error in case of invalid input)
- In case of error, the program should terminate with proper reason.

Maintainability
- Predefine normal and inverted direction priority lists (not needed, but would be easier to read)
- Add clear comments explaining tricky rules (loop detection, teleporters, breaker mode)
- Write unit tests to cover each special rule (important, need a lot more test cases)

Performance
- Avoid excessive allocations (use map[StateKey]bool instead of map[string]bool)

Developer Experience 
- Provide clear error messages (distinguish loop vs stuck conditions) (add a flag/properties in runner to change what to record, for example teleport can be recorded in path)
- Add optional debug logging for robot steps (use logger to log different types of state changes)

README
- Project description / summary is needed
- Installation / Usage / Setup Instructions are needed in readme (go run ..)
- Add Testing instructions (go test ...)
